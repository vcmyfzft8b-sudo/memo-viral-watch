"""Weekly clean-up: formats that perform badly leave the list (Monday, first run of the week).

There is no fixed number of spots. Every format in the list has a current-form score (rank.form: how likely one
video of it does well right now, Astra AI + our own creators; 1.0 = an average format at the moment).

A format leaves the list when ALL of this is true:
- its current form is below lineup.remove_below (1.0 = below an average format right now),
- it had no viral video in the last 21 days and is not hot,
- it came into the list more than lineup.protect_days ago (new formats get time).
The list never shrinks below lineup.min_formats (the weakest leave first).

Leaving = every market's page moves to that market's archive (nothing is deleted). Formats only come INTO the list
when they go viral: new ones are built, archived ones come back automatically (main.handle_viral).

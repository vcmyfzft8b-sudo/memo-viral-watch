"""When is an Astra AI video "taking off" or "viral"? Thresholds live in config.json.

Taking off (early warning): within its first 6 / 24 / 48 hours a video has 5k / 20k / 50k views,
or (within 72h) at least 10x its creator's usual views and 5k+.
Viral (confirmed): 100k+ views within the watch window (7 days).
Quality: (shares + saves) / views >= 1.5%. Weak-engagement videos still alert, but are flagged and
never trigger a new format page.
